## SCD30 Tests
- Require atleast 2 sec to produce a new reading. Functional check is provided for that.
- Maintain short and proper connections to the device, this sensor is succeptable to the undervoltage and underpower.
- Test your du-point connectors before use (they should be conductive with resistance lesser than 1 ohm).
- Always use 3.3 volts supply for the operation. More than 5.5 volt would **likely fry** this expensive sensor.
- Use a logic-level converter if 3.3v logic is not available.
- Power seems to be a issue with this module, while taking measurement make sure that voltage does not drop below 3.3v. If this happens use a separate powersupply or use 5v for the operation.
