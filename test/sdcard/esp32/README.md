## ESP32 SD Card Tests
- Implementation for Sd Card in ESP32 using VSPI.
- Maintain short and proper connections to the device, this sensor is succeptable to the undervoltage and underpower.
- Test your du-point connectors before use (they should be conductive with resistance lesser than 1 ohm).
- Always use 3.3 volts supply for the operation. More than 5.5 volt would **likely fry** this expensive sensor.
- Use a logic-level converter if 3.3v logic is not available.
